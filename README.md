# Mythical Beast Generator

A generator I wrote in Python to make Mythical Beasts of various kinds. It runs on a webpage thanks to [Skulpt](http://skulpt.org). Special thanks to my pal Stuart for contributing to the word lists.

I made this as the first project of something I've whimsically dubbed "One Figment a Fortnight", where I try to release a project every 2 weeks in 2015.

At some point, I'll hopefully come back to do some clean-up and update the word lists and add some more art assets (I had a really long list of animals that I had to whittle down as my hand started to cramp).

Feel free to tweet suggestions, questions, and complaints to [@ianmart1n](http://twitter.com/ianmart1n).
